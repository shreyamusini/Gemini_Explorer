# Gemini_Explorer
In this mission, I learned how to use Google Gemini's API, paired with streamlit, to create a chat interface. I learned how to set up an LLM, how to define the functionalities, and pair the model with streamlit for an interactive online user interface. This chat interface has an initial user input for their name and location. Gemini will then use those pieces of information to greet the user and present a fun fact about their location as its initial message.
